# SSM Compiler

This was a compiler I made for a course for my Master's.
It got reworked completely at the end real quickly for the last assignment, which was creating an extension.
The extension is a LSP implementation.

Neither the LSP nor the SSM compilation are truly finished due to a lack of time.
This was made "together" with someone as a group project, but I ended up doing all the work, which is why it never got finished.

SMM is from:
